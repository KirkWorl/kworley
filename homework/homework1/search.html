                        <p>Machine learning <span id="imprtnt">plays a core part at almost every part of the stack</span> at large search engines like 
                        <span class="blue">G</span><span class="red">o</span><span class="yellow">o</span><span class="blue">g</span><span class="green">l</span><span class="red">e</span>
                        or

                        <br>
                        Machine learning plays an important role in search engines, and is currently one of the biggest avenues in which machine learning is making progress. It is 
                        utilized in search rankings, where systems can learn how to better rank queries and results via different types of search rankings. Machine learning is also 
                        embedded in understanding any particular query; It helps address problems like query classification, spelling suggestions, query expansion, and intent 
                        disambiguation. Another area it assists in is search features. These can be things like site links, knowledge graphs, and items other than the actual results.
                        Yet another area machine learning is crucial in, and one of the biggest functions of a search engine is web crawling. To index webpages and make them accessible
                        search engines first have to 'crawl' the web, that is, visit webpages and take snapshots. Machine learning helps systems learn how often to crawl a particular
                        site, and the optimal manner in which to do so. These are just a couple of areas in which machine learning has made its mark on search engines, and will continue
                        to develop in the future.
